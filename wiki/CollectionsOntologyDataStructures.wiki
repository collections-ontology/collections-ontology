== Set ==
A *Set* is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. All the elements of the set are directly linked to it through the property _co:element_. In RDF, identical elements connected by the same property are, by default, treated as a set.

== Bag ==
A *Bag* is a collection that can have multiple copies of each element. This is performed through the _co:Item_ entity. The _co:Item_ is linking exactly one resource through the relationship _co:itemResource_.
