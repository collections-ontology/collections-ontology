#summary Collections Ontology (CO) Home.

== Introduction ==

The Collections Ontology (CO) defines unordered collections (Set and Bag) and ordered collections (or List) in OWL DL. The Collections Ontology has been heavily inspired by the work "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.96.3862 Putting OWL in Order: Patterns for Sequences in OWL]" by Drummond et al. (OWL-ED 2006).

=== History ===

This ontology has been first published in 2007 as SWAN Collections - as it was part of the project SWAN (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine). However, since the origin, the ontology has been conceived as a separate orthogonal module with no dependencies from the rest of the SWAN ontology ecosystem.
