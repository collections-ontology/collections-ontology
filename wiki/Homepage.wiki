#summary Collections Ontology Home.

= Introduction =

The Collections Ontology (CO), originally defined as SWAN Collections, defines unordered collections (Set and Bag) and ordered collections (or List) in OWL DL. This ontology has been inspired by the work "Putting OWL in Order: Patterns for Sequences in OWL" by Drummond et al. (OWL-ED 2006).
