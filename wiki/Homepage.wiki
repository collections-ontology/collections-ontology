#summary Collections Ontology (CO) Home.

== Introduction ==

The Collections Ontology (CO) defines unordered collections (Set and Bag) and ordered collections (or List) in OWL DL. The Collections Ontology has been heavily inspired by the work "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.96.3862 Putting OWL in Order: Patterns for Sequences in OWL]" by Drummond et al. (OWL-ED 2006).

=== OWL File ===
You can access the latest version of the Collections Ontology (CO) OWL file here: [http://purl.org/co/]. Or access the human readable version of it available through the open source tool [http://lode.sourceforge.net LODE] (Live OWL Documentation Environment).

=== History ===

This ontology has been first published by [http://www.paolociccarese.info/ Paolo Ciccarese] in 2007 as SWAN Collections - as it was part of the project SWAN (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine). However, since the origin, the ontology has been conceived as a separate orthogonal module with no dependencies from the rest of the SWAN ontology ecosystem. Since March 2010 the ontology has been renamed Collections Ontology (CO) and is now maintained by Paolo Ciccarese and Silvio Peroni.
