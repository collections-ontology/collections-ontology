#summary Handling ORE proxies with co:List

== The ORE specification and its features ==
The [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel Open Reuse and Exchange specification] (ORE specification) is a standard defined by the [http://www.openarchives.org/ Open Archives Initiative] for describing and exchanging aggregations of Web resources.

The main concept of this specification is the _Aggregation_, i.e., a particular resource that aggregates, either logically or physically, other resources, as shown in the following figure:

It is possible to use particular kinds of resources, called [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel#Proxy proxies], so as to refer to a specific aggregated resource in a context of a particular aggregation.

Moreover, by using proxies, we can specify an order (with an external vocabulary) for aggregated resources of an aggregation, if needed, as shown in the following figure:
