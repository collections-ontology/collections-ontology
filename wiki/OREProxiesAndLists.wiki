#summary Handling ORE proxies with CO

== The ORE specification and its features ==
The [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel Open Reuse and Exchange specification] (ORE specification) is a standard defined by the [http://www.openarchives.org/ Open Archives Initiative] for describing and exchanging aggregations of Web resources.

The main concept of this specification is the _Aggregation_, i.e., a particular resource that aggregates, either logically or physically, other resources, as shown in the following figure:

http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel-images/ReMAggregates.jpg

It is possible to use particular kinds of resources, called [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel#Proxy proxies], so as to refer to a specific aggregated resource in a context of a particular aggregation.

Moreover, by using proxies, we can specify an order (with an external vocabulary) for aggregated resources of an aggregation, if needed, as shown in the following figure:

All these scenarios can be easily integrated with CO.

== Bibliographic collection as set of aggregated records ==
Bibliographic collections, handled by particular software such as [http://www.mendeley.com Mendeley], are just set of aggregated bibliographic records. Usually, these collections are used by authors of articles and nooks to store and retrieve specific references they cite within their works.

In the previous snippet both ore:Aggregation and co:Set are used to describe the composition of a bibliographic collection through two different vocabularies. A much compact definition of these assertions can be easily done by adding a bit of ontological alignment between the two ontologies and, then, inferring what is not explicitly asserted. For instance, if the following Manchester Syntax extension of ORE is considered:

{{{
Prefix: ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/>
Prefix: co:  <http://purl.org/co/>

Class: ore:Aggregation
    SubClassOf: co:Set

ObjectProperty: ore:aggregates
    SubPropertyOf: co:element
}}}

we can infer all the co:Set statements starting from the following ones:

{{{
@prefix ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/> .
@prefix doi: <http://dx.doi.org/> .
@prefix :    <http://www.example.com/> .

:myOwnBibliographicCollection a ore:Aggregation
    ; ore:aggregates
          doi:10.1080/13614568.2010.497194 
        , doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2008.04.010 .
