#summary Handling ORE proxies with CO

== The ORE specification and its features ==
The [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel Open Reuse and Exchange specification] (ORE specification) is a standard defined by the [http://www.openarchives.org/ Open Archives Initiative] for describing and exchanging aggregations of Web resources.

The main concept of this specification is the _Aggregation_, i.e., a particular resource that aggregates, either logically or physically, other resources, as shown in the following figure:

http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel-images/ReMAggregates.jpg

It is possible to use particular kinds of resources, called [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel#Proxy proxies], so as to refer to a specific aggregated resource in a context of a particular aggregation.

Moreover, by using proxies, we can specify an order (with an external vocabulary) for aggregated resources of an aggregation, if needed, as shown in the following figure:

http://www.openarchives.org/ore/1.0/datamodel-images/Proxy.jpg

All these scenarios can be easily integrated with CO.

== Set of cited papers ==
Our personal scientific library, composed by a large number of works, is actually an aggregation (and a set) of different papers. This scenario can be described in OWL through both ORE and CO as follows:

{{{
@prefix ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/> .
@prefix co:  <http://purl.org/co/> .
@prefix doi: <http://dx.doi.org/> .
@prefix :    <http://www.example.com/> .

:myOwnLibrary a ore:Aggregation
    ; ore:aggregates
          doi:10.1080/13614568.2010.497194 
        , doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2008.04.010 .

:myOwnLibrary a co:Set
    ; co:element
          doi:10.1080/13614568.2010.497194 
        , doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2008.04.010 .
}}}

In the previous snippet both ore:Aggregation and co:Set are used to describe the composition of a bibliographic collection through two different vocabularies. A much compact definition of these assertions can be easily done by adding a bit of ontological alignment between the two ontologies and, then, inferring what is not explicitly asserted. For instance, if the following Manchester Syntax extension of ORE is considered:

{{{
Prefix: ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/>
Prefix: co:  <http://purl.org/co/>

Class: ore:Aggregation
    SubClassOf: co:Set

ObjectProperty: ore:aggregates
    SubPropertyOf: co:element
}}}

we can infer all the co:Set statements starting from the following ones:

{{{
@prefix ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/> .
@prefix doi: <http://dx.doi.org/> .
@prefix :    <http://www.example.com/> .

:myOwnLibrary a ore:Aggregation
    ; ore:aggregates
          doi:10.1080/13614568.2010.497194 
        , doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2008.04.010 .
}}}

== Bibliographic references of a paper ==
When we are writing a scientific paper, we use to refer to bibliographic references, each of them referencing a precise paper, for explicitly citing other works in our paper. Of course, two bibliographic references, even when defined in two different papers and referring to the same work, can have associated particular (and contextual) metadata that change reference by reference. For example:

{{{
@prefix ore: <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/items/> .
@prefix doi: <http://dx.doi.org/> .
@prefix :    <http://www.example.com/> .

:myOwnBibligraphicCollection a ore:Aggregation
 .
