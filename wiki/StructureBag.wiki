#summary Bag in Collections Ontology

[UnderstandingCO << Understanding CO]

== Bag ==
A *Bag* is a collection that can have multiple copies of each element. This is performed through the _co:Item_ entity. The _co:Item_ is linking exactly one resource through the relationship _co:itemContent_.

In the v2.0 of Collections Ontology, thanks to the new [http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/PR-owl2-overview-20090922/ OWL2] feature named [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Property_Chains Property Chains], it has been possible to infer automatically the belongingness to a bag, i.e., all the _co:element_ relations between a bag instance and all the other objects it effectively contains, that are de-referenced through items and the related properties _co:item_ and _co:itemContent_ for allowing repetition. This inference mechanisms is implemented through the following assertion:

{{{
ObjectProperty: co:element
	SubPropertyChain: co:item o co:itemContent
}}}
