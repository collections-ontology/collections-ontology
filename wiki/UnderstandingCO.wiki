#summary Understanding CO

== Understanding Collections Ontology (CO) ==

Collections Ontology (CO) is an OWL ontology currently representing three different data structures: 
 * *[StructureSet Set]* implements a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements 
   * Introduction to the [StructureSet co:Set]
   * Example: [SetExample1 Defining the Set of the CO contributors]
 * *[StructureBag Bag]* implements a collection that can have multiple copies of each element ([StructureBag learn more])
   * Introduction to the [StructureBag co:Bag]
 * *[StructureList List]* (or Sequence) implements an ordered collection of elements, where the same element may occur more than once
   * Introduction to the [StructureList co:List]

Alignments with other efforts:
 * [OREProxiesAndLists Handling ORE proxies with CO]
Examples:
 * [SetsExample1AndFoafGroup Collections Ontology and FOAF Group] 
 * [ListExamplePaperAuthorsFaBiO Defining a list of authors of a paper in FaBiO using CO]
