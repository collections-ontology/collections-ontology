== Understanding Collections Ontology (CO) ==

Collections Ontology (CO) is an OWL ontology currently representing three different data structures: 
 * [CollectionsOntologyDataStructures Set, Bag and List]. 
 * [OREProxiesAndLists Handling ORE proxies with CO]
 * Examples 
   * [SetExample1 Defining the Set of the CO contributors]
   * [SetsExample1AndFoafGroup Collections Ontology and FOAF Group] 
   * [ListExamplePaperAuthorsFaBiO Defining a list of authors of a paper in FaBiO using CO]
